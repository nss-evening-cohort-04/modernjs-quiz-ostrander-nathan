// You'll be building robots to battle each other.
// When your user interface first loads, provide 2 text inputs to name the two robots that will do battle.
// You must also provide a select element underneath each text input so that the user can select one of the 6 robot models you defined.
// Provide a Attack! button that, when clicked, simply applies the damage output of each robot against the other one.
// Once either robot's health is <0 display a message that the battle is over, and which one won. For example...
// The Viper Drone defeated the Behemoth ATV with its flamethrower.
